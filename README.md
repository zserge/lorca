<p>
	A very small library to build modern HTML5 desktop apps in Go. It uses Chrome
	browser as a UI layer. Unlike Electron it doesn't bundle Chrome into the app
	package, but rather reuses the one that is already installed. Lorca
	establishes a connection to the browser window and allows calling Go code
	from the UI and manipulating UI from Go in a seamless manner.

## Features

* Pure Go library (no cgo) with a very simple API
* Small application size (normally 5-10MB)
* Best from the two worlds - the whole power of HTML/CSS to make your UI look
	good, combined with Go performance and ease of development
* Expose Go functions/methods and call them from JavaScript
* Call arbitrary JavaScript code from Go
* Asynchronous flow between UI and main app for both languages (async/await and Goroutines)
* Supports loading web UI from the local web server or via data URL
* Supports embedding all assets into a single binary
* Supports testing your app with the UI in the headless mode
* Supports multiple app windows
* Supports packaging and branding (e.g. custom app icons). Packaging for all
	three OS can be done on a single machine using GOOS and GOARCH variables.

Also, limitations by design:

* Requires Chrome/Chromium >= 70 to be installed.
* No control over the Chrome window yet (e.g. you can't remove border, make it
	transparent, control position or size).
* No window menu (tray menus and native OS dialogs are still possible via
	3rd-party libraries)

If you want to have more control of the browser window - consider using
[webview](https://github.com/zserge/webview) library with a similar API, so
migration would be smooth.

## Example

```go
ui, _ := lorca.New("", "", 480, 320)
defer ui.Close()

// Bind Go function to be available in JS. Go function may be long-running and
// blocking - in JS it's represented with a Promise.
ui.Bind("add", func(a, b int) int { return a + b })

// Call JS function from Go. Functions may be asynchronous, i.e. return promises
n := ui.Eval(`Math.random()`).Float()
fmt.Println(n)

// Call JS that calls Go and so on and so on...
m := ui.Eval(`add(2, 3)`).Int()
fmt.Println(m)

// Wait for the browser window to be closed
<-ui.Done()
```

Also, see [examples](examples) for more details about binding functions, embedding
assets and packaging binaries.

## How it work

Under the hood Lorca uses `Chrome DevTools Protocol` to instrument on a Chrome instance. First Lorca tries to locate your installed Chrome, starts a remote debugging instance binding to an ephemeral port and reads from `stderr` for the actual WebSocket endpoint. Then Lorca will open a new client connection to the WebSocket server, and instruments Chrome by sending JSON messages of `Chrome DevTools Protocol` methods via WebSocket. JavaScript functions are evaluated in Chrome, while Go functions actually run in Go runtime and returns would be sent to Chrome. See more on `Chrome DevTools Protocol` in [here](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/).

## What's in a name?

> Probably it was the beginning of a poem. (J. Brodsky)

Lorca is an anagram of [Carlo](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/carlo/), a
project with a similar goal for Node.js.
